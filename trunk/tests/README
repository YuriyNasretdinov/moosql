These are parallel tests only for YNDb part and do not cover SQL

As they are parallel, they use pcntl_fork(), which is NOT enabled by default in PHP

They will not work under Windows unless PHP is compiled with PCNTL support,
which is only possible under Cygwin. I haven't managed to do this yet...

Under other UNIXes you may also need to (re)compile PHP with PCNTL support

E.g. under Mac OS X the following sequence works perfectly (it should work under any *nix):

$ ./configure --enable-cli --enable-pcntl --without-iconv
$ make

After this process, use "sapi/cli/php" binary to run the tests.

The *.php files are the different tests that are used for testing MooSQL in the development process

"data/" directory is the directory with test tables

COMMENT ON "parallel-*.php":

	These parallel tests are only for YNDb part and do not cover SQL

	As they are parallel, they use pcntl_fork(), which is NOT enabled by default in PHP

	They will not work under Windows unless PHP is compiled with PCNTL support,
	which is only possible under Cygwin. You can use cygport to compile PHP from source,
	but you will need to make modifications to the .cygport file itself to add pcntl support.

	The complete Cygwin installation with working PHP binary will be available in some time.

	Under other UNIXes you may also need to (re)compile PHP with PCNTL support

	E.g. under Mac OS X the following sequence works perfectly (it should work under any *nix):

	$ ./configure --enable-cli --enable-pcntl --without-iconv
	$ make

	After this process, use "sapi/cli/php" binary to run the tests.

= Introduction =

The MooSQL is a project which has the intention to build an RDBMS in pure PHP with support of MySQL syntax for queries and which would have relatively high performance on big data sets.


= Details =

== 1. What API is available at the moment? ==

MooSQL now only supports the core API, primarily YNDb.

It supports create() / select() / insert() and update() methods which allow you to create new tables, perform simple select queries from tables, insert data into the table and update contents of existing rows with only limitation that you cannot increase length of text fields.

YNDb supports indexed and auto-incremented fields with ability to have UNIQUE indexes as well. Text fields cannot be indexed at the moment.

== 2. How do I begin to work with MooSQL? ==

First, do `svn checkout` of the latest version from `/trunk` to some directory, e.g. `moosql`.

Then, in your PHP script, include `moosql/Client.php` and create new YNDb instance:

{{{
<?php
include 'moosql/Client.php';

$MOO = new YNDb('data_directory');
...
}}}

The *_data_directory_* is the directory where MooSQL will store its' data. This directory must be readable and writable for a PHP script. Also it is recommended to deny web access to this directory either by placing it outside DocumentRoot or by placing .htaccess file with the following contents (Apache with enabled AllowOverride only):

{{{
deny from all
}}}
